### Description
The Bikesahare project will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. A script was written to take in raw input to create interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Installation

The following software are required for this project:

``````
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
A text editor such as like Atom.
A terminal application(Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)
``````

### Files used
The following files were used for the data analysis:- 
1) [chicago.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V4WH42QnOgkA0tfLjK9UrDOp0A0S2UTQ)
2) [new_york_city.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mQeu8YlBxMj1B33BZsEZYjSSPyOpVc0a)
3) [washington.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rxtaCQSfgBYoOHU1Vm_dYeF3P2Ff7-1n)

``````
run python bikeshare.py
``````

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1) Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2) End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3) Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4) Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5) End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6) User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
